        <p>Note: SVG Viewbox h & w preserves aspect ratio stopping at first dimension to be reduced(? verify?)</p>
        <p>Viewbox is an attribute commonly used when creating SVG shapes. If you think of the document as a canvas, the view box is part of the canvas you want the viewer to see. Even though the page may cover the entire computer screen, the figure may only exist in a third of the whole.</p><p>Viewbox allows you to tell the parser to zoom in on that third. This eliminates the extra white space. Think of view box as a virtual approach to crop an image. Without it, your graphic will appear a third of its actual size.</p><h3>Viewbox Values</h3><p>To crop an image, you must create points on the picture to make the cuts. The same is true when using the viewbox attribute. The value settings for viewbox include:</p><ul><li><code>minx</code>—the beginning x coordinate</li><li><code>miny</code>—the beginning y coordinate</li><li><code>width</code>—width of the view box</li><li><code>height</code>—height of the view box</li></ul><p>The syntax for viewbox values is:</p><p>viewBox&#61;&#34;0 0 200 150&#34;</p><p>Do not confuse the width and height of the view box with the width and height you set for the SVG document.</p>
